# 🧠 NeuroVox AI — Voice-Based Cognitive Health Screening

> **Detect early signs of Alzheimer's and cognitive decline through voice biomarkers, powered by MIT & Harvard research.**

Built for **v0 Prompt to Production 2026** | Data & Ops Track

---

## 🎯 What It Does

NeuroVox AI analyzes **50+ voice biomarkers** from a simple voice recording to screen for early signs of cognitive decline. The system extracts acoustic features validated by peer-reviewed research and generates a clinical-grade narrative report using Azure OpenAI.

### Key Features
- 🎙️ **Voice Recording** — Record directly in the browser or upload audio files
- 🧬 **50+ Biomarkers** — Jitter, Shimmer, HNR, MFCC, F0, Formants, Pauses, Speech Rate
- 📊 **Clinical Dashboard** — Visual scores for Voice Quality, Fluency, Prosody, Articulation
- 📝 **AI Narrative Report** — Clinical-grade report generated by Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)
- 📚 **Research-Backed** — Based on eGeMAPS standard and published AD detection studies

## 📊 Voice Biomarkers Analyzed

| Biomarker | Description | AD Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Jitter** | Pitch perturbation (F0 variation) | Increased = vocal instability |
| **Shimmer** | Amplitude variation | Increased = reduced neuromuscular control |
| **HNR** | Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio | Decreased = breathier voice |
| **F0 Variability** | Pitch dynamics | Decreased = monotone speech |
| **Pause Patterns** | Silence frequency/duration | Increased = word-finding difficulty |
| **Formants** | F1, F2, F3 frequencies | Reduced variability = imprecise articulation |
| **MFCC** | Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients | Vocal tract shape changes |
| **Speech Rate** | Voiced/unvoiced ratio | Decreased = cognitive slowing |
